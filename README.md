Met on discord at 5pm to discuss project details, and divide out work. Here is link to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pCrzvWXF4yZpCi_FmnKuRyMFsfaez11LSaAhWlaeaDY/edit?usp=sharing">document</a> detailing how we will divide out work.

We decided that we will import the Unreal Starter Kit for character movement and other basic functions that will make it easier to get a good start on our game. We will create a new directory for all content directly pertaining to our game and create subdirectories for:
* Spawnable Objects
* GUI
* Character
* Textures
* (Others TBD)

We set a goal of having all Spawnable objects completed by April 8th, so we can start dragging and dropping into levels for level design.
